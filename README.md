This contains the structured Gaussian projection as well as our Projection operator based on
FastFood of Le, Sarlos and Smola, 2013. 
We also compare with Damle and Sun, 2014 which uses Gaussian random projections.
Finally, we also compare with TSQR implementation of Benson and Gleich, 2014. 

Our projection operator is in the spiral wht package directory.
